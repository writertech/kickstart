# kickstart

Pulling together the Linux kickstart tree I've carried with me through many companies over the past 20 years.. currently builds a Red Hat compatible OS (ent 3 thru 7, and probably 8), and has worked for Fedora (though tested less/only occasionally).<br>
(note: started on Linux around `98 with Red Hat 5.2 being the first version I saw, so this probably originally worked before Enterprise, before Fedora Core)

More info to come..  

(some docs may be on thelinuxsource.org - need to verify what's there for kickstart)
